# Public-Human-Assault-Prediction-
Developed an innovative Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system driven by AI to proactively predict public human assaults in real-time. Recognizing human activities from video sequences or still images is a challenging task due to problems, such as background clutter, partial occlusion, changes in scale, viewpoint, lighting, and appearance.Â 
Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model. 
Human Activity Recognition plays a significant role in human-to-human and human-computer interaction. 
So this system will not only be cost effective but also as a utility-based system that can be incorporated in a large number of applications that will save time and aid in various activities that require recognition process, and save a lot of time with good accuracy
