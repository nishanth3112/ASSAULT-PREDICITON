# Human Activity Recognition and Assault Detection System

This project leverages deep learning and advanced video processing techniques to develop a robust Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system. The goal is to detect abnormal activities such as public assaults and provide real-time alerts and evidence to law enforcement through an integrated mobile application.

## Overview
- **Objective**: 
  - Develop a cost-effective and accurate model for human activity recognition.
  - Deploy the system for real-time road surveillance and public safety.
  - Provide law enforcement with live streaming and alert notifications via a mobile application.
- **Key Features**:
  - Recognizes six types of human actions (e.g., walking, jogging, boxing) using video data.
  - Identifies abnormal activities, sending instant alerts to authorities.
  - Includes a mobile app for live streaming and notifications.

## System Features
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilized the **KTH video dataset**, comprising 2,391 sequences of six activity types captured under varied scenarios.
   - Collected real-time video data for training and validation.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Standardized video frames through techniques like grayscale conversion and dimensionality alignment.
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracted pixel and optical flow features to analyze motion and spatial-temporal patterns.
4. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - Implemented a **Spatio-Temporal Neural Network** for activity classification.
   - Achieved high accuracy in recognizing and classifying human activities.
5. **Mobile Application**:
   - Built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
   - Provides real-time notifications and live streaming to law enforcement.
6. **Visualization**:
   - Designed interactive dashboards for visualizing model performance and activity patterns.

## Results
- Successfully detected and classified abnormal activities with high precision.
- Enabled live streaming and alert notifications, enhancing public safety.
- Demonstrated effective real-time deployment for road surveillance.

## Future Scope
- Enhance prediction accuracy with advanced algorithms.
- Extend application to various environments, such as homes, banks, and commercial spaces.
- Incorporate additional activities and deploy in diverse surveillance systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning**: Spatio-Temporal Neural Network.
- **Programming**: Python.
- **Tools**: Google Colab, Android Studio.
- **Frameworks**: React Native for mobile app development.

This project demonstrates the potential of integrating AI and mobile technology to improve public safety and streamline surveillance operations.
